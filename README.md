How do I approach designing software?
I break it down into parts and design and code each part on its own.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
It has helped me in designing triangles and planes.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The same one I laid out before, I broke it down into parts and then coded.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
It can be applied by allowing me to follow the guidelines set forth in the paperwork.

How do I approach developing programs?
I develop programs piece by piece and building each module on its own.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I first would draw the plane and then attempt to draw the objects on top of it with the vertices.

How did iteration factor into your development?
You must iterate through loops to get a repetative draw on things like cylinders.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
It has evolved by teaching me to use multiple classes to develop my objects.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I want to be a softwae engineer and comp sci will help me by teaching me all of the details and classes I need to know.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
It allows me to think in 3D and make sure I can visualize the project.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I think the knowledge I gained in C++ can help me extensivley  in the future.
